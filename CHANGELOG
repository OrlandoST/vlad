* Starting change log.
* Added failure scenario “silent”.
* Removed \ay\vlad\Result::getPassed() and \ay\vlad\Result::getAll(). \ay\vlad\Result::getFailed() and \ay\vlad\Result::filter() merged into one.
* Added "Equal" validator: value must be present and must be equal to the supplied value.
* Added "Match" validator: value must be present and must be equal to the value resolved using another selector.
* Input::getSubject() is now expecting string selector representation instead of Selector instance.
