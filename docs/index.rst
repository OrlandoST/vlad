Vlad
====

Vlad is input validation library. 

Vlad has [in-built validators] for the most common validation tasks. You may write [custom validators] and request new validators to be added to the core package (https://github.com/gajus/vlad/issues). The custom validator classes will benefit from the [translator interface]. However, Vlad does not promote inline boolean validation rules.

Vlad is OCD-free way to perform 

Vlad is input validation library designed to use succinct syntax with extendable validation rules and multilingual support.
